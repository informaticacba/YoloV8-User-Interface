# YoloV8-User-Interface
This is a simple user interface for YOLOv8, a popular object detection system. The program allows the user to select a video or image file and a YOLO model file, and then run YOLO on the selected input using the specified model. The output of YOLO is displayed in the GUI window, along with a progress bar that updates as YOLO processes the input.
